# Methods vs functions in NumPy

Many things are implemented in NumPy as both *functions* and *methods*.  For
example, there is a `np.sum` function, that adds up all the elements:

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
arr = np.array([1, 2, 0, 1])
np.sum(arr)
```

There is also a `sum` method of the numpy `array` object:

```{python}
type(arr)
```

```{python}
arr.sum()
```

Nearly all the method versions do the same thing as the function versions.
Examples are `mean`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `reshape`.  Choosing the
method or the function will usually depend on which one is easier to read.
